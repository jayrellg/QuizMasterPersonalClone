# NavBar

## Purpose
NavBar is a component that is displayed on every page of the website that contains a link to various pages of the website. Depending on the role of the user, or whether the user is logged in or not, the navbar will adjust the icons available to reflect that state.

NavBarUser is a slightly different version of the navbar that shows up in the top right corner instead of the left side of the page. NavBarUser will simply display the user's email and a button to logout when the user is logged in.
