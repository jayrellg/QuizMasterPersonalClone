# Functions/index.js

## Purpose
This file contains the main cloud functions for creating, taking, and sending quizzes as well as their scores.

Essentially, anything that needs to go to and from the database has a cloud function here.

Keep in mind that these functions will have to be updated before any results will be seen on the testing or production website.
